# Implementations of Daniel Bernstein's ChaCha stream cipher

Intended to be a collection of implementations of ChaCha/{20,12,8}; and
to contain some test-cases useful in addition to the Strombergson I-D
test vectors. (In particular, this repo will eventually include KATs
that approach stream positions `n == 0 % 2^32` from below.)

The implementations are, so far as possible, generated by Python code;
a ninja script is included for testing.

Little-endian support only; this dramatically simplifies code at
essentially no cost.

The implementation in `chacha/vec/kr.c` is experimental and untested;
it hews closely to Krovetz's vectorization approach.

On systems with AVX2, the Gull-Gueron code[^gollgueron] is faster than
Krovetz; it also handles streams of length > 2^32.
